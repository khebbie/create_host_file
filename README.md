create_host_file from the disconnect source
This script gets advertising hosts from the disconnect services json and creates a host file.
The host file can be copied to block advertising hosts to be contacted form your computer.

Please note using the host file generated as your own host file is something you do at your own risk.
I do not recommend that you do it, please use your own judgement to choose what is right.
Furthermore please do a manual sanity check of the file before copying it to /etc/hosts.
